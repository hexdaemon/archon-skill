## Platform Support

✅ **Linux** - Full support (all operations)  
✅ **macOS** - Full support (Docker Desktop)  
⚠️ **Windows** - WSL2 recommended (see WINDOWS.md)

**Cross-platform operations:**
- Public API queries (all platforms)
- Keymaster CLI via npx (all platforms with Node.js)

## Quick Start

**Public network operations (all platforms):**
```bash
# Check network status
~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-stats.sh

# Resolve a DID
~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-resolve.sh did:cid:bagaaiera...
```

**Local node operations (requires local Archon node):**
```bash
# List your DIDs
~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-list-ids.sh

# List credentials
~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-list-credentials.sh

# Create new DID
~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-create-did.sh "name" "agent"

# Backup to vault
~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-vault-backup.sh vault-name file.db backup-key
```

## What This Skill Provides

**Public Network (Read-Only, All Platforms):**
✓ DID resolution (W3C spec compliant)  
✓ Network statistics and monitoring  
✓ Health checks  
✓ Integration with OpenClaw's `web_fetch` tool  

**Local Node (Full Capabilities, Requires Docker):**
✓ Create and manage DIDs  
✓ Issue verifiable credentials  
✓ Encrypted vault storage  
✓ Group management  
✓ Document signing  
✓ Cross-platform identity linking

## Local Node Setup

For full capabilities, run a local Archon node:

🔧 **[Install Archon locally](https://github.com/archetech/archon)** — Docker-based, includes keymaster + gatekeeper

**Installation:**
```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/archetech/archon ~/archon
cd ~/archon
docker compose up -d

# Verify running
curl http://localhost:4226/api/v1/ready  # Keymaster
curl http://localhost:4224/api/v1/ready  # Gatekeeper
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
export ARCHON_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/archon"
export ARCHON_PASSPHRASE="your-secure-passphrase"
mkdir -p "$ARCHON_CONFIG_DIR"
```

**Windows users:** See WINDOWS.md for platform-specific setup.

## Key Endpoints

**Public Network:**
| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `https://archon.technology/api/v1/status` | Network stats |
| `https://archon.technology/api/v1/ready` | Health check |
| `https://archon.technology/api/v1/did/<did>` | Resolve DID |

**Local Node (if running):**
| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `http://localhost:4226` | Keymaster (wallet operations) |
| `http://localhost:4224` | Gatekeeper (DID resolution) |
| `http://localhost:4228` | Web wallet UI |
| `http://localhost:3003` | Grafana metrics |

---

## Use Cases

1. **Verify credentials** — Check if issuer DID exists
2. **Monitor network** — Track growth and health
3. **Identity discovery** — Explore agent DIDs
4. **Cross-platform** — Link Archon + Nostr identities

---

## Verification

All commits are signed with Archon DID:
```
did:cid:bagaaieratn3qejd6mr4y2bk3nliriafoyeftt74tkl7il6bbvakfdupahkla
```

The `manifest.json` file contains SHA256 hashes of all repo files, cryptographically signed. Verify with:

```bash
npx @didcid/keymaster verify-file manifest.json
```

To regenerate after changes (requires ARCHON_PASSPHRASE):
```bash
./scripts/sign-repo.sh
```
